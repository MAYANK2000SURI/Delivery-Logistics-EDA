## Delivery/Logistics Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Dashboard
This project involves the creation of a Power BI dashboard to analyze delivery and logistics data. The dashboard provides key insights into shipment performance, delivery trends, and route optimization. It aims to assist logistics teams in identifying inefficiencies and improving delivery performance.

Key Features:
	•	Total Shipments: Displays the total number of shipments processed.
	•	Average Delivery Time: Tracks the average time taken for deliveries.
	•	On-Time Deliveries vs Delayed Shipments: Highlights delivery performance percentages.
	•	Total Distance Covered: Analyzes the overall distance covered by all shipments.
	•	Cut-off Analysis: Compares cut-off compliance metrics.
	•	Route Type Analysis: Provides insights into route categories (e.g., Carting vs FTL).
	•	OSRM vs Actual Distance and Time: Compares planned vs actual distances and times using Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM).
	•	Average Actual Time by Day of Week: Identifies patterns in delivery times across weekdays.
	•	Start-to-End Scan Distance: Visualizes distance metrics from start to end of scans.

Tools and Technologies:
	•	Data Source: [Specify the data source, if applicable]
	•	Visualization Tool: Power BI
	•	Programming Tools: SQL (if used for preprocessing)
	•	Skills Utilized: Data cleaning, visualization, and EDA.
